title: About me
---

I am a senior PhD candidate with a background in biochemical engineering and six years of experience in the fields of computational biology and genomics. I am currently finishing my PhD dissertation at UC Davis in the [Dennis Lab](https://www.dennislab.org/), where I study complex genomic variation in great apes and its role in primate-specific traits and diseases, leveraging long-read sequencing technologies and multi-omics data. Previously, I worked as a bioinformatics research assistant at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile in plant transcriptomics.

I was born in Santiago, Chile. My hobbies include digital drawing, playing string instruments, singing, reading, writing, taking care of my plants, and going on long walks/hikes. I would love to meet over coffee/tea to talk about science and reproducible bioinformatics.
